<p>This project contains two approaches to recommendation systems: Collaborative filtering and matrix factorization.</p>

<h3> Collaborative Filtering </h3>
<p> In collaborative filtering approach, the recommendation matrix is built via the user-based and item-based approaches. this is the implimentation of this article (https://towardsdatascience.com/intro-to-recommender-system-collaborative-filtering-64a238194a26). The predictions were accurate in this case.</p>

<h3> Matrix Factorization </h3>
<p>Matrix factorization is a more efficient and advanced approach to recommendation systems. the paper for matrix factorization is https://datajobs.com/data-science-repo/Recommender-Systems-[Netflix].pdf originally developed for netfilx reccomendation system.</p>
